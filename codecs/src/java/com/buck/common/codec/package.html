<p> A <i>codec</i> is named mapping between sequences of raw bytes, and
sequences of encoded bytex, in the sense defined in <a
href="http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc4648.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;4648</i></a>.  A
<i>decoder</i> is an engine which transforms encoded bytes in a specific
encoding into raw bytes (binary content), and an <i>encoder</i> is an engine
which transforms bytes (binary content) into an encoded sequence of bytes.
Encoders and decoders operate on byte buffers.  They are collectively referred
to as <i>codecs</i>.

<p> The {@link com.buck.common.codec.Codec} class defines methods for creating
    coders for a given codec and for retrieving the various names associated
    with
    a codec. It also defines static methods for testing whether a particular
    codec is supported, for locating codec instances by name, and for
    constructing a map that contains every codec for which support is available
    in the current Java virtual machine.

<p> Most users will not use these classes directly; instead they will use the
existing codec-related services such as XML serialization, which may have been
reworked to make use of the codec facilities defined in this package.

<p> Support for new codecs can be made available via the interface defined in
    the {@link com.buck.common.codec.spi.CodecProvider} class in the
    {@link com.buck.common.codec.spi} package.
